# Bug hunt

Most bugs wait until a user trips on them. A hunt goes looking first: it reads one area as a skeptic, keeps only the bugs it can make go **red**, and leaves each one where a human can act on it at a glance: a draft pull request with green checks, or an issue an agent could pick up. Run to the end on your own; anything for the human goes in the report.

Write the report in the user's active language, and pull requests and issues in the project's.

## 1. Scope

Take the area the user names, or the one with the strongest signal: suspected bugs `garden` filed, churn hot spots in history, fixes that came back, code merged without tests, skipped or intermittent tests, `TODO` and `FIXME` notes, and errors the project's logs expose. Prefer an area no recent hunt covered. Every issue and pull request a hunt opens carries the `bug-hunt` label, created when the project lacks it, so earlier hunts show where they looked. State the choice and pin the revision.

## 2. Hunt

Read the area's code, its callers, its tests, and its history; use `why` when defensive code or a strange shape needs its reason. Ask what breaks it: which inputs, states, orderings, retries, and failures; which errors are swallowed; what the code assumes and never checks; where a test asserts less than its name claims. Where state interacts, enumerate the **state space** as `strategic-programming` defines it.

Record each **suspect** in a queue with the observed evidence, and change nothing yet. When the area is larger than one reader can hold, split it into lanes along owner boundaries and give each lane to a fresh read-only agent.

Done when every file in scope has been read and every suspect has an evidence line.

## 3. Confirm

Turn each suspect into a reproduction at the narrowest faithful boundary: a test, or the real product driven through the project's verification method. It counts only when it goes red for the right reason, the bug and not the setup, and goes red again on a second run when time, concurrency, or external state is involved. Reproduce by driving inputs; state inspection may confirm a symptom but never inject it. When the mechanism stays uncertain, diagnose it under `diagnosing-bugs`.

A suspect without a red reproduction is dropped and reported with what was tried. When the code's own contract (its spec, tests, documentation, types, or an ADR) cannot say whether the behavior is wrong, it is a question for the human, not a bug.

Group the confirmed bugs by cause: one cause becomes one pull request or one issue, however many symptoms it has.

Done when every suspect is red or dropped, and every red one belongs to a cause.

## 4. Sort

Check every cause against what already exists, searching open and closed issues and pull requests by symptom, area, and error signature:

- An open pull request, an open issue, or a person's claim already covers the cause: comment the reproduction where it lacks one, and leave the fix and the filing to them.
- A closed issue or a merged fix for the same symptom is a regression lead: treat the cause as new and link it.

A remaining cause is **easy** when all of these hold:

- its cause lives in one owner;
- the correct behavior follows from the code's own contract, not from a product decision;
- the fix opens no one-way door as `architect` defines it;
- the reproduction can stay as a maintained regression test.

Fix at most three easy causes per hunt unless the user sets another limit, most severe first; file the rest with everything else.

Done when every cause is covered, easy, or to be filed.

## 5. Fix

Fix each easy cause on its own branch off the base, in its own draft pull request:

1. Commit the red reproduction as a regression test on its own, before the fix, the way `deliver` commits its acceptance tests.
2. Repair the cause at its owner under `strategic-programming`, including the instances of the same cause the hunt found, and run the project's gates.
3. Run `refine` in a fresh context with the diff and the reproduction.
4. Run `ship`, opening the pull request as a draft. Its description carries the reproduction, the root cause, and the test's red-then-green output.

When the fix stops being easy partway through, because it reaches another owner, meets a one-way door, or breaks a test that encodes behavior someone relies on, discard the branch and file the cause with what the attempt taught.

## 6. File

File each remaining cause as one issue with the project's bug label, written so an agent could pick it up without asking:

- **Title:** the area and the symptom; a guessed cause stays out of it.
- **Current and expected behavior**, and where the expected one comes from.
- **Reproduction:** the test or the steps, with their red output.
- **Cause:** the mechanism when diagnosed; otherwise hypotheses, labeled as hypotheses.
- **Code:** permalinks pinned to the hunted revision.
- **Acceptance criteria** a reviewer can check, and what is **out of scope**.
- **Why not fixed here:** the easy condition it failed.

## Report

End with:

- the area, why it was chosen, and the revision hunted;
- each draft pull request with its cause and check state;
- each issue filed or commented on;
- suspects dropped, and why;
- questions about intended behavior, each with the behavior in plain words and a recommendation;
- what was not read or run, and why.

A hunt that confirms nothing is a result: report where it looked.

## Boundaries

- Pull requests stay drafts. Marking one ready, merging, and closing an issue belong to the human.
- Behavior-preserving cleanup the hunt notices belongs to `garden`; name it in the report.

## Done

Every suspect is confirmed red or dropped with a reason, every confirmed cause sits in exactly one draft pull request with green checks, one issue, or one comment on an existing issue or pull request, and the report is delivered.
