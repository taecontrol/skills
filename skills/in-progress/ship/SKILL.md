# Ship

A pull request is ready when the human can merge it without asking anything. Green checks in CI, not on this machine, are the bar.

## Prepare

The branch holds only durable work: temporary artifacts such as specs, prototypes, and reports stay out of it. When the work came from a spec, check that what must outlive it is in the change, not only in the spec. Bring the branch up to date with its base, and rerun the project's gates when that changed anything.

## Open

Push the branch and open the pull request against its base, following the project's conventions for titles and descriptions. Write the description as a briefing, not a lab notebook:

- **Why:** the problem and the issue it closes.
- **What changed:** the behavior and the scope, including what was left out.
- **Evidence:** the acceptance tests that prove each example, and screenshots or recordings for the examples that needed a look, attached where the platform allows or otherwise located.
- **Deviations:** every difference from the spec, every changed acceptance assertion, and decisions the delivery made on its own.
- **Review:** `refine`'s report.
- **Follow-ups:** what is real but was left out.

Leave out empty sections.

## Drive checks to green

Watch every check until it finishes. For each failure, find why it fails in CI when it passed locally, such as a different platform, browser, path, timeout, or concurrency, fix the cause, and push again. A check that passes only on a retry is flaky, not green: diagnose it with `diagnosing-bugs`. Make checks pass by fixing code, tests, or configuration; disabling a check or weakening a test to get green does not count. When a failure is outside the change, show that it fails on the base too and say so in the pull request.

When a failure needs something you cannot get, such as a secret, infrastructure access, or a human decision, stop and name it.

## Done

Every check is green, the description matches the final state, and the pull request is ready to merge. The human merges.
