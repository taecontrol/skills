# <Title>

Status: Draft | Accepted
Issue: <link, when there is one>

## Problem

Who has it, what it costs them, and how they cope today. Label each piece of evidence `observed`, `reported`, or `assumed`.

## Outcome

What is true for the user when this is done, in one short paragraph.

## Out of scope

What we are deliberately not doing, and why when it is not obvious.

## Examples

The definition of success. Each one is concrete: starting state, action, and result.

- **E1** `test` — Given …, when …, then …
- **E2** `test` — Given …, when …, then … must never happen.
- **E3** `capture` — The screen matches the chosen prototype at <sizes/states>.

When state interacts, add the state space the edge cases come from:

| State \ Operation | … | … |
|---|---|---|
| … | expected result | expected result |

## Test boundary

- **Where the tests run:** the interface (UI, API, CLI, or module seam) and the tool.
- **Real target:** the app, runtime mode, data, and platforms the examples must hold under.
- **Stand-ins:** each fake or fixture for an external system, and the observation that shows it behaves like the real one.

## Decisions

Each settled decision with a pointer to its evidence: the chosen prototype, the architecture result, a spike verdict, a data shape or contract, a budget with the check that enforces it. Every one-way door is here with its `architect` result.

## Rabbit holes

Known traps and how to avoid them.

## Context

Pointers an implementer needs: files and modules, related issues, research, spikes, prototypes, ADRs, coding standards.

## Open questions

Empty before acceptance.
